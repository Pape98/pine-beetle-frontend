    {/* <p id="pred-model-intro-text">This page allows you to use the predictive tool to anticipate the severity of southern pine beetle spots in a given locality.
      The model requires four input variables: number of spots 2 years ago, number of spots 1 year ago, number of clerids 1 year ago, and number of
      Southern Pine Beetles this year. The model then returns the probability that the number of spots will be within certain pre-defined ranges.
      For convenience, this tool allows you to select a year, state, and/or forest and it will automatically input the data for that selection. Initially,
      the system will select the current year. You can also conduct “what-if” analysis, by clicking the “edit” button near the model inputs.
