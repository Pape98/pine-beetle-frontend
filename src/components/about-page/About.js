    					<h2>About the Project</h2>
                  <p>After developing a model at Dartmouth College to predict outbreaks and movements of Southern Pine Beetles, Professor Ayres and Aoki approached Dartmouth’s DALI Lab to design and develop a tool to visualize the trapping data and predictions gathered annually. This project aimes to deploy a product that field researchers, USFS personel, and the general public can use to understand trends in pine beetle movements.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>This project carries on the work of Ron Billings of the Texas A&M University Forest Service (retired). Since 1987, Ron has coordinated annual predictions of summer SPB outbreak, based on spring trapping data provided by cooperators across the southern range of the beetle (Billings and Upton 2010). Our work builds on Ron’s tireless dedication to supporting and improving the prediction system over the past 30 years. </p>
